The purpose of this Sales Tracker Analysis is to provide data-driven insights that optimize business decision-making in sales, pricing, inventory, and profitability.

**PURPOSE:** The purpose of your Sales Tracker Analysis is to provide data-driven insights that optimize
business decision-making in sales, pricing, inventory, and profitability. Specifically, this analysis aims to:

* Monitor sales performance by tracking revenue, profit margins, and sales trends over time
* Enhance pricing strategy by comparing unit selling price with wholesale price to refine markup
decisions
* Understand customer behavior by identifying patterns in purchases, best-selling categories, and
discount effectiveness
* Optimize inventory management by analyzing loss rates and returns, reducing stock waste
* Improve business efficiency by ensuring resources are allocated effectively based on data-backed
insights.

**METHODOLOGY** ðŸ› 
1. DATA SOURCES
Data was collected an online platform named Kaggle, after which it was imported into Power BI
for cleaning, modelling and visualization.
2. Data Preparation and Cleaning
* Imported the dataset containing all four tables into Power BI after the data was collected from
kaggle.
* Removing of duplicates.
* Standardized columns and values
3. DATA VISUALIZATION
Power BI was used for creating various visualizations, such as bar charts, column charts, doughnut
charts, and area charts to represent the data visually and make it easier to understand and
interpret.
* DASHBOARD SLICERS
To enhance insights, we added slicers for sales or return, discount rate and date, enabling easy
data segmentation and trend analysis across different products.
* DAX Measure: DAX was used to create new measures for Total Profit, Total Revenue, Total Cost
and Profit Margin.

**KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OVERVIEW:**
The key performance indicators (KPIs) obtained from the analysis were;
* TOTAL REVENUE: This is the total sum earned from the supermarket sales over the stipulated
time.
* TOTAL PROFIT: This is the net profit realized after sales and other expenses has been factored in.
* AVERAGE UNIT SELLING COST: The average selling cost for the products available.
* AVERAGE LOSS RATE: This is the average loss rate for all products during sales time.

**KEY INSIGHT:**

Imagine your revenue performance as a journey. In 2020, the business was sailing smoothly with modest
revenues. In 2021, a strong wind propelled it to a peak of around $1.1M, suggesting robust market
conditions or successful strategies. However, by 2022, the winds began to slacken, and revenues fell to
about $0.9M. In 2023, a fierce headwind emerged, dropping revenues further to $0.6M. This decline hints
at challenges impacting the business's momentum.
What could have caused this downturn? It might be a combination of broader economic headwinds
reducing consumer spending, intensifying market competition, or even internal operational disruptionsâ€”
like supply chain issues or inefficienciesâ€”that stifled the earlier momentum. Shifts in consumer
preferences or regulatory changes increasing costs may also have played a role.

**RECOMMENDATION**

To steer the business back on course, start by conducting a thorough market analysis to pinpoint external
factors like economic trends and competitor strategies. Reassess your pricing model and cost structure to
ensure competitiveness without eroding margins. Evaluate your operational processes to identify and
remedy any inefficiencies, whether in production, distribution, or supply chain management. Moreover,
investing in product innovation and targeted marketing campaigns could help regain consumer
confidence and stimulate demand. Diversifying the product portfolio might also reduce the impact if one
segment faces issues, creating additional revenue streams to hedge against market volatility.
By understanding these factors and acting upon them, you can transform recent setbacks into an
opportunity for strategic realignment and renewed growth.

**TOTAL PROFIT PER ITEM NAME:**

**KEY INSIGHTS:**

This chart above shows Total Profit Per Item, highlighting variations in profitability across different products. 
The item Xixia Mushroom (1) generates the highest profit, close to $100K, followed by Paopaojiao (Jingpin), 
Red Pepper (1), and Yunnan Lettuces, all exceeding $60K in profit. Conversely, items like Hongshujian, Caixin, 
and Yunnan Leaf Lettuce (Bag) have significantly lower profits, some nearing zero or negative values. 
This indicates a profit imbalance, where certain products contribute substantially to revenue while others underperform.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Addressing this issue starts with a closer examination of the factors influencing the revenue and sales downturn. 
Investigate whether the decline in sales is linked to changes in customer preferences, competitive pricing strategies, 
or potential supply chain disruptions that could affect product availability or quality. Once the root cause is 
identified, consider implementing targeted marketing campaigns aimed at re-engaging customers, perhaps through promotional 
offers or loyalty programs. Additionally, review the pricing strategy to ensure that the unit selling price is both 
competitive and aligned with market expectations while safeguarding the profit margin. Streamlining operations to reduce 
waste and improve efficiency may also help reverse the downward trend in profit. Finally, consider diversifying the product 
range to mitigate dependency on a narrow set of offerings, which may prove vulnerable to shifts in market demand.
